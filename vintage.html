                            Started by a husband and wife team and ended by their divorce, Ohio Scientific produced interesting home and business computers in the 1970s and early 1980s. Restoration, maintenance, and related projects for my Challenger III triple-processor system.

                            Founded in 1982 at Stanford University, Sun Microsystems produced UNIX workstations, servers, UNIX-like operating systems, and other software until their acquisition by Oracle in 2010. Their hardware lives on, sometimes still performing useful, modern tasks.

                            The XT-IDE began as a VC Forums/N8VEM project to build an open source 8-bit ISA IDE controller and has progressed through several major developments. Here you'll find information on past XT-IDE runs as well as the new rev 3 board we're working on.
