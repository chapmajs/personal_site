<p>Weâ€™re going to control something mains powered with a computer! In the case of my old, low-feature EPROM eraser, this means that if a <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/Bad-Thing.html">Bad Thing</a> happens, the UV lamp could turn on which is potentially damaging to eyes and skin! Always unplug whatever youâ€™re controlling before working on it, <strong>DO NOT DEPEND ON THE SOFTWARE/COMPUTER TO DO THE RIGHT THING!</strong></p>
