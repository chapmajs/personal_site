I""<p>Today’s the 16th anniversary of the last CD-ROM release of the Walnut Creek CP/M Archive. This was a massive shareware/freeware archive hosted by the Walnut Creek guys over at ftp.cdrom.com years ago. Unfortunately, it’s gone now. There are several people with mostly complete mirrors, but I’ve been unable to find a full image of the CD-ROM anywhere. After <a href="http://www.thenexthope.org/">The Next HOPE</a>, a friend managed to create a copy of his copy of the archive and send it to me. I’m re-releasing it via BitTorrent, in hopes that it will remain available to future CP/M users. Get the torrent file <a href="http://www.glitchwrks.com/vintage/walnut_creek_cpm_archive.torrent">here</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The archive is now being hosted at the <a href="http://filedump.glitchwrks.com/software/vintage/cpm/walnut_creek/">Glitch Works File Dump</a> as well as being available via BitTorrent.</p>

Walnut Creek used to host thousands of pieces of shareware for various 
platforms through their ftp.cdrom.com FTP server, including the Simtel archives
and the Aminet Amiga software archives. Periodically, "shovelware" CD-ROMs
would be produced to provide users with an OS-centric collection of useful
applications without having to download them all individually.

This particular release of the Walnut Creek CP/M archive was release 16 years
ago today and includes many pieces of hard-to-find shareware and freeware for
the CP/M operating system. Along with CP/M software, there are a few DOS 
utilities for browsing and decompressing the archive files featured on the CD.

Unfortunately, if you're not using DOS, most modern compression suites don't
support the old archive formats used with this release. Many of them are LBR
archives, and if you're running a *NIX system, can be decompressed with lbrate:

Jeff Jonas of FERRETRONIX was kind enough to archive the entire CD-ROM for me
to help in my search of a particular piece of software for the Kaypro II.
