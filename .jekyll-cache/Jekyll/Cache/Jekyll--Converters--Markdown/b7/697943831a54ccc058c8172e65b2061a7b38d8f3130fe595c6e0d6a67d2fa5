<p>The Solid State Music IO-2 is one of my favorite S-100 boards: I’ve used it to build a <a href="/2011/09/01/debug-board">debug board</a>, a <a href="/2012/01/30/io2-rom-ram">1702A ROM/2101 RAM board</a>, and a <a href="/2013/04/17/power-on-jump">power-on jump board</a>, as well as other projects that I haven’t documented online. Its versatility comes from the minimal address decoding and I/O laid out in copper – the rest of the board is prototype space. It’s usually the board I grab when I want to quickly interface a project to the S-100 bus. Unfortunately, vintage IO-2 boards are difficult to find. They’re also usually populated with someone else’s old project. While cleaning up a vintage board for reuse, I decided to fully strip it down and send it to <a href="http://www.mhtest.com/">Mile High Test Services</a> for high resolution scanning. This allowed me to make reproductions of the board, here’s a first run prototype, built up as a simple parallel I/O board:</p>

</div>

<p>It’s hard to find a board house that will run circuit boards with colored FR-4, so I tried an experiment with this run: I created a solder mask layer that exposes all of the traces, covering only the spots that would’ve been bare FR-4 if I had run the boards with no solder mask. As seen above, I think the effect worked nicely. The board doesn’t look exactly like an original, which I sort of count as a bonus anyway, since it would be harder to pass off as original by an unscrupulous seller. Here’s a closeup of the SSM logo etched in the copper in the regulator area, even this part came out alright:</p>

<p>With the prototype design tested and confirmed, it was time to do a small production run. I knew several people from the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/s100computers">s100computers.com Google Group</a>, <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/altaircomputerclub/info?v=1&amp;t=directory&amp;ch=web&amp;pub=groups&amp;sec=dir&amp;slk=7">Altair Computer Club</a>, and various other groups would want reproduction boards, so I ordered a large enough run to make hard gold edge plating affordable. Hard gold is critical for long term durability of edge connectors, ENIG is not sufficient. Here are the results:</p>

<p>As with all of my reproduction boards, this one has a note stating it’s not vintage:</p>

<p>The first one I built up became an 8-bit LED output register:</p>

</div>

<p>The wiring was done with different colors from 25-pair telephone wire:</p>

<p>Just as with the prototypes, the production boards work fine! If you’re interested in getting your own reproduction Solid State Music IO-2 board(s), see the links to our Tindie store at the top of this writeup. Bare boards and full parts kits are availble. If you’d like something custom built on an IO-2 board for your system, please <a href="https://services.glitchworks.net/ng/messages/new">contact us</a> and describe what you’d like built – we’re happy to build custom interfaces!</p>
