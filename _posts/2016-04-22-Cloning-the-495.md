title: Cloning the OSI 495 Prototype Board
topic: Making new OSI 495 Prototype Boards
category: osi
description: The Ohio Scientific bus is pretty easy to interface with, except prototype boards are hard to find! Chunks of perfboard large enough are expensive, the insertion/extraction force of the Molex KK-156 connectors required soldered connections, and Ohio Scientific's 495 protoboard is unobtainium. When I finally found an OSI 495 board, I decided to clone it.

Since acquiring my [Challenger III](/2016/04/20/challenger-3-cleanup) I'd wanted to find a prototype board for the OSI bus. Having a protoboard would let me build a debug board as I had [for the S-100 bus](/2011/09/01/debug-board), to assist in repairing the nonworking boards left over from the combination of my Challenger III boards with those that my boss had. I could also build a more reliable 48K + 8K all-in-one RAM board using a modern high density static RAM rather than a pile of SEMI4200 static RAMs. Unfortunately, original Ohio Scientific 495 prototype boards are hard to come by -- I know of one other original in existence (also being used as a RAM board!), and [Mark Csele](http://www.technology.niagarac.on.ca/people/mcsele/OhioScientific.html) had remarked in an email that they were probably unobtainable.

Additionally, 8x10" or larger sheets of perfboard or even punchboard are expensive. They don't have pads for the Molex KK-156 connectors used with the OSI bus, and the high insertion force of the KK-156 connectors had resulted in ripped-off connectors on a previous attempt to epoxy connectors to a large piece of perfboard.

A lack of 495 boards resulted in vintage solutions like this:

This is a vintage homebrew ROM board I picked up from a popular online auction site. As you can see, a small single-sided board was hand etched to carry the KK-156 connectors, which was then glued to a large chunk of prototype board. Unlike my attempt, this one appears to hold on pretty solidly. I was thinking about replicating the small carrier board when I came across an actual OSI 495 board for sale:

It was in good condition with very little of the prototype space used -- it appears the previous owner never got past laying down sockets and some basic wiring. My plan was originally to turn this into a combination debug/RAM board, but in talking with [Grant Stockley](http://www.altairkit.com/) about duplication of S-100 boards, I decided to instead clone the board. I used Grant's recommendation of scanning services from [Mile High Test Services](http://www.mhtest.com/), a Colorado-based shop specializing in high resolution conversion of PC board art into CAD files.

My board went off to Mile High Test Services and was scanned as a single-sided job. I specified no clean-up, to preserve the original "look and feel" of a board laid out with tape and acetate: not all lines are perfectly straight, holes are off-center, et c. I received a set of Gerber files, which I was able to manipulate with [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) and re-export as Gerber files:

This worked out pretty well, and the board went off to the manufacturer for a small prototype run. I ran the board as single-sided, no plated-through holes, no solder mask, no silkscreen -- just like the original. I did add a bit of text in the bottom-left corner indicating that the board was a reproduction:

Aside from one small flaw in a power trace (doesn't affect functionality), it turned out great! I ran a small number of these boards as a test. So far, there hasn't been a lot of interest in doing a larger run; however, if you'd like to purchase one of the initial boards or put your name in for a purchase on a larger run, [let me know](https://services.theglitchworks.net/ng/messages/new) via the contact form.
