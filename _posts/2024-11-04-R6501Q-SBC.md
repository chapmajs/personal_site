description: The Rockwell R6501Q processor has always intrigued me, but is nearly impossible to breadboard a computer with due to the QUIP64 packaging! With the recovery of ROM data from the Sontec FORTH computer, I wanted to design a single-board computer around the R6501Q to make use of some of the R6501Qs I'd acquired over the years.

I learned about the Rockwell R6501Q single-chip microcomputer from [Burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_Macneal) while working at Sontec/ITI Audio during college. Burgess had used it in the [Sontec FORTH computer]({% post_url 2022-09-28-Sontec-FORTH-Computer %}), and had all of the documentation he used to create the design, as well as his personal design experience to share. The R6501Q is essentially a 6502 processor core with onboard I/O, timers, and a small amount of RAM, plus a few additional instructions from the 65C02 family. I acquired several R6501Q processors over the years. Despite all of these neat features and compatibility with a processor whose architecture I already understood, I never actually built anything with them, since breadboarding with a R6501Q is basically impossible: they're packaged in a QUIP (QUad Inline Package), which is essentially two ZIP footprints!

After getting the [Sontec FORTH computer]({% post_url 2022-09-28-Sontec-FORTH-Computer %}) working, and finding that the EPROM contained a copy of Rockwell's FORTH development system, I was motivated to actually create a single-board computer for the R6501Q, and began laying one out. As VCF East 2020's virtual date was approaching, I decided to also use the board as the virtual workshop project for the year. Here's the initial prototype:

{% linked_image :file => 'assembled_prototype.jpg', :alt_text => 'Assembled prototype R6501Q SBC' %}

Features, as designed include:

* R6501Q at 1 MHz, or R6501AQ at 2 MHz
* 32K static RAM, FeRAM compatible
* 32K EEPROM, paged in 4K segments
* Power-on boot to EEPROM, with support for ROMFS
* Onboard serial port with RS-232 level shifting
* Software-selected bitrate using an onboard counter/timer
* Two uncommitted 8-bit I/O ports (`PORTB` and `PORTD`)
* Glitchbus expansion

The prototype board worked without modification with my R6501Q! There were a few software issues, but nothing that required a change in board layout: [TangentDelta](http://tangentideas.info) helped with the initial port of [Steve Wozniak's 6502 ROM monitor]() to the R6501Q by customizing a simulator he'd written for the 6502. There was a mistake made with the bitrate generation, and an incorrect assumption about the integrated RAM and I/O in the R6501Q. Both of these were easily corrected. Having the simulator available before the prototype boards were even finished was a huge benefit!

One of the issues with designing a SBC for the R6501Q was, of course, the processor socket. We tried several kinds of machine pin socket strips with varying grip strength, as well as NOS single-wipe sockets Burgess still had in the stockroom from the Sontec FORTH computer project. All sockets ended up mangling pins on the R6501Q on extraction, and were not easy to get the chip seated into to begin with. In the end, we decided that soldering the CPU without a socket was the best approach; however, the prototypes were built up using the machine pin strips:

In addition to the R6501Qs I'd bought over the years, I also had a couple R6511Qs. These are very similar one-chip microcontrollers, with two key differences: the I/O lacks internal pullups, and the clock circuit divides the input by two, instead of by four. From the datasheet, it looked as if simply adding four pull-up resistors would make the board compatible with the R6511Q, so this was tried on a prototype:

{% linked_images :files => ['r6511q_resistors.jpg', 'r6511q_socket.jpg'], :alt_texts => ['R6511Q pull-up resistors added to a SBC prototype', 'R6511Q installed'] %}

This worked, and so the SBC was renamed the "R65X1Q SBC" to indicate it was compatible with both processors.

Both prototypes were tested with a Glitchbus 8255 PPI board, to begin verifying Glitchbus compatibility:

{% linked_image :file => '8255_board_test.jpg', :alt_text => 'Glitchbus 8255 PPI board connected to R6501Q SBC prototype' %}

The 8255 PPI board worked as expected! Glitchbus defines a 256-byte I/O space, compatible with the I/O space used by the Intel 8080/8085, which the 8255 PPI board uses for addressing. The 6502 and derivatives use memory-mapped I/O, with no separate I/O instructions or space. In order to accomodate this, the R65X1Q SBC allocates 256 bytes of memory from `0xEF00` to `0xEFFF` (directly below ROM) for I/O. When any address in this page is accessed, the Glitchbus `BIO**M` line is driven high, indicating that the bus transaction is an I/O transaction.

### Production Board and Kit

With the minor changes required to support the R6511Q on the same SBC, the R65X1Q SBC production etch was run and tested:

{% linked_image :file => 'production_board.jpg', :alt_text => 'R65X1Q SBC production board' %}

This board worked correctly without modification. An update was made to the BOM, specifying 220R pull-down resistor packs, to deal with the variance of integrated pull-up resistors on the R6501Q: current measurements across prototypes indicated that the pull-ups were anywhere from somewhat under 1K to 7K! The original BOM value of 2.2K caused unreliable switchpack reading for some of the R6501Q processors tested.

The above production design was used to create the R65X1Q SBC kit, which was featured in a virtual workshop for VCF East 2020. A trimmed down version of the livestream assembly session for the workshop can be viewed here:

The initial software load cosisted of the [enhanced Woz mointor]() and our port of [Tom Pittman's TINY BASIC](). With the SBC design finalized, [TangentDelta](http://tangentideas.info) and I could begin work on porting ROMFS to the R6501Q and getting RSC-FORTH working on the SBC!
